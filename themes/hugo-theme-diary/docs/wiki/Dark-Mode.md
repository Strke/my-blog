Dark mode is a brand-new function introduced in 1.2.0.
If you don't like this feature, you can disable it.

## Disable Dark Mode

Add `disableDarkMode=true` to the section of `[param]` in your `config.toml`.
Then you will not see it.

## Automatically enable Dark Mode

Add `enableAutoDarkMode=true` to the section of `[param]` in your `config.toml`.
